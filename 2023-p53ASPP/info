This folder contains scripts supporting the p53-ASPP computation work.

The MD trajectories of this project are deposited into the Zenodo repository (https://zenodo.org/records/10349773). 
Due to the file size limitation and uploading efficiency, we extracted every 100th frame of  the Martini CGMD trajectories to compress the file size. 
Note: In our analysis, we extracted every 40th frame to perform the analysis.
